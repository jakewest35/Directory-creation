# Directory-creation

A simple directory creation script that will create a project folder and subdirectories in a specified path on a UNIX-based system.

## To install:

0. Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. Any version after 3.0 is ok.

1. Clone this repo.

2. move directoryCreation.py to your root folder and give it read/write/execute permission by entering the following command:
  `mv directoryCreation.py ~ && chmod 700 directoryCreation.py`

4. Open directoryCreation.command and replace '{ ENTER THE ABSOLUTE PATH TO YOUR DESIRED DIRECTORY HERE }' with your desired directory path, removing the braces and leaving the quotes. Save and close the file.

You're all set! In the terminal, you should now be able to execute the script with the following command:

	`./directoryCreation.command`
